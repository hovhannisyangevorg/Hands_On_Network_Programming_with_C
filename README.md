**Learn socket programming in C and write secure and optimized network code**

## What is this book about?
Network programming, a challenging topic in C, is made easy to understand with a careful exposition of socket programming APIs. This book gets you started with modern network programming in C and proper usage of the relevant operating system APIs.

This book covers the following exciting features:
-	Uncover cross-platform socket programming APIs
-	Implement techniques   for supporting IPv4 and IPv6
-	Understand how TCP and UDP connections work over IP
-	Discover how hostname resolution and   DNS work
-	Interface with web APIs using HTTP and HTTPS
-	Acquire hands-on experience with the email protocol (SMTP)
-	Gain real-world expertise with practical network applications  
-	Explore new approaches for   the Internet of Things (IoT)

This repo contains the code which accompanies the book "Hands-On Network
Programming with C", written by Lewis Van Winkle. The code is released under
the MIT license.

Unless otherwise noted, all programs will compile cleanly on Windows, Linux,
and macOS, and as C or C++. Code is tested with MinGW and Visual Studio on
Windows, gcc and clang on Linux and macOS.

## Required Software

Following along with the code in this book requires that you to have access to a C compiler on a standard operating system. The example programs in this book were carefully tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS. They were tested using the gcc, clang, and Microsoft Visual Studio compilers. All of the code in this book will compile as either C or C++.

In addition, the code examples in Chapter 9, Loading Secure Web Pages with HTTPS and OpenSSL, and Chapter 10, Implementing a Secure Web Server, require that you have the OpenSSL library installed.

Chapter 11, Establishing SSH Connections with libssh, requires that the libssh library is installed.

Instructions for installing all of the require software are provided in the appendices. See Appendix B, Setting Up Your C Compiler On Windows, Appendix C, Setting Up Your C Compiler On Linux, and Appendix D, Setting Up Your C Compiler On macOS, for compiler setup. A complete list of the example programs provided is given in Appendix E, Example Programs.

No non-free software is required to follow along with any of the examples in this book.
